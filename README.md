# Deep lost in space

This is a game, where movement is based on acceleration. You can accelerate and until another force is taking place, you will continue in a constant velocity.

The planets and stars pull you with tremendous amounts of force so you cannot escape them.


Explore the space, survive and try to navigate while being pulled by a bunch of massive stars and planets.

In future, i may add some more elements, such as obtaining water from asteroids, or making some stars explode.
