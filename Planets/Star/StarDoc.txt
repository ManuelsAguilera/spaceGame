This class is suposed to be like a planet, however its mass must be massive and atract other objects.
Without being atracted to anyone, by creating multiple stars we can distribute more randomly the planets.
When a body enters a certain radius, from inside to the outside of the star, the body should dissapear.
The dissapeared body should die, and respawn, or simply dissapear.
